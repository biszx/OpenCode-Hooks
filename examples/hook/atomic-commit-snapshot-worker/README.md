# Snapshot autocommit, SQLite version

This setup gives you one hook, one worker, and one SQLite queue per worktree.
It watches file edits, snapshots them into git objects, then replays them as
real commits after a short quiet window.

If you want the short version:

- `snapshot-hook.py` captures file changes and queues them.
- `snapshot-worker.py` drains the queue and publishes commits.
- `snapshot_shared.py` coordinates branch generation and same-branch ownership
  through repo-common-dir shared state.
- Each worktree gets its own isolated state under its private git dir.
- Target contract: exact capture is guaranteed only for supported hook surfaces
  and supported worktree or branch topologies.
- Target contract: incomplete payload surfaces are best-effort. Unsupported
  branch or worktree topologies should be rejected early or quarantined later,
  not replayed in a degraded mode.
- Built-in AI commit messages are optional. If AI is off or skipped, the worker
  uses `SNAPSHOTD_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CMD` if configured, otherwise deterministic
  commit messages.

## What it does

There are three files:

- `snapshot-hook.py`
  - Reads hook payload JSON from stdin
  - Figures out which files changed
  - Hashes current file contents into git blobs
  - Consults shared branch state before enqueue
  - Writes an event plus `path_tail` updates in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
    transaction
  - Wakes the live worker with `SIGUSR1`, or spawns one if needed

- `snapshot-worker.py`
  - Waits for a quiet window
  - Replays pending events onto the current branch tip using a temporary git
    index
  - Publishes with `git update-ref` compare-and-swap
  - Uses a two-phase publish so crashes can be recovered on restart

- `snapshot_shared.py`
  - Resolves the repo root, worktree git dir, and repo-common-dir
  - Maintains shared per-branch registry state in the repo common dir
  - Rejects unsupported same-branch multi-worktree ownership
  - Tracks branch generation so rewritten or recreated branches can quarantine
    stale local queue state

Why split it this way? The hook stays cheap and fast. It just captures state.
The worker does the expensive part later, once edits settle down. The shared
helper exists because the queue is still worktree-local, but branch ownership
and generation now need one repo-scoped source of truth.

## Where state lives

Put `snapshot-hook.py` and `snapshot-worker.py` in the same directory. By
default, the hook finds the worker via `__file__`. If you need to override it,
set:

```bash
export SNAPSHOTD_WORKER_PATH=/abs/path/to/snapshot-worker.py
```

Make both scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x snapshot-hook.py snapshot-worker.py
```

Each worktree stores its own state inside its private git dir.

Examples:

- main worktree: `/path/to/repo/.git`
- linked worktree: `/path/to/repo/.git/worktrees/<name>`

The hook and worker create these paths automatically:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `<git-dir>/ai-snapshotd/snapshotd.db` | SQLite queue, WAL mode |
| `<git-dir>/ai-snapshotd/worker.lock` | Singleton worker lock |
| `<git-dir>/ai-snapshotd/worker.index` | Temporary git index for replay |
| `<git-dir>/ai-snapshotd/logs/hook.log` | Rotated hook debug log |
| `<git-dir>/ai-snapshotd/logs/worker.log` | Rotated worker debug log |
| `<git-dir>/ai-snapshotd.incompatible-<stamp>-<pid>/` | Quarantined local state from an incompatible older schema |
| `<git-common-dir>/ai-snapshotd/branch-registry/*.json` | Shared branch owner + generation registry |
| `<git-common-dir>/ai-snapshotd/branch-registry/*.lock` | Per-branch coordination locks |

This isolation matters. Five projects with three worktrees each means fifteen
independent queues and fifteen independent workers, not one shared bottleneck.
It also means branch ownership is **not** repo-global today. A worktree-local
queue can be exact for its own supported edit surfaces, but it must not pretend
to coordinate the same branch across multiple worktrees unless future work adds
explicit shared branch coordination.

### Local versus shared state

The implementation is now intentionally hybrid:

- **Worktree-local state** stays in `snapshotd.db`
  - `events`
  - `event_ops`
  - `path_tail`
  - `reconcile_pending`
  - `worker_state`
- **Repo-shared state** lives under `branch-registry/`
  - current branch owner worktree
  - branch head observed by the snapshot system
  - branch generation / incarnation tracking

That means the system still replays from one local queue per worktree, but it no
longer treats `branch_ref` alone as enough identity for safe replay.

If the hook or worker finds an incompatible older local schema, it now
quarantines that worktree-local `ai-snapshotd/` directory once and recreates a
fresh current-state DB automatically. Shared `branch-registry/` state is left
alone.

## How it works now

### 1. Capture path

1. `snapshot-hook.py` resolves the repo root, worktree git dir, and repo common
   dir.
2. It asks `snapshot_shared.py` for the current branch registry entry.
3. If the same branch is actively owned elsewhere, capture is rejected instead
   of silently enqueueing unsafe work.
4. The hook stores the event in the local queue with both:
   - `branch_ref`
   - `branch_generation`
5. Local shadow state such as `path_tail` is also keyed by branch generation, so
   old shadow state cannot be reused after a rewrite unnoticed.

### 2. Replay path

1. `snapshot-worker.py` reads only the local worktree queue.
2. Before replay, it refreshes shared branch registry state.
3. It replays only rows whose `branch_generation` still matches the shared
   generation and whose `base_head` ancestry is still valid.
4. If the branch was rewritten or the topology is unsupported, the worker
   settles those rows as `blocked_conflict` instead of replaying them.

### 3. Why this is three files now

Before, the example could treat the worktree-local SQLite DB as the whole state
model. After adding branch generation and same-branch ownership guards, that was
no longer enough.

So the responsibilities are now split like this:

- `snapshot-hook.py`: capture and local enqueue
- `snapshot-worker.py`: replay, publish, and reconcile
- `snapshot_shared.py`: repo-shared branch identity and ownership checks

That third file is not a second queue. It is the minimal shared coordination
layer needed to keep the existing local queue model safe.

## Event states

Current code already uses these states today. The broader topology and
branch-generation quarantine meanings below describe the target semantics that
future implementation is intended to add.

| State | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `pending` | Captured and waiting to replay |
| `publishing` | Commit objects are built and `update-ref` is next |
| `published` | The branch now includes the event |
| `blocked_conflict` | Replay was rejected because the state no longer matches. In the target contract, this is also the settled quarantine state for unsupported topology or stale branch generations. |
| `failed` | Hard error during replay or commit creation |

`publishing` is intentionally transient. If the worker crashes between
`update-ref` and DB settlement, startup recovery checks whether the target
commit made it into history and fixes the state from there.

## Capture contract

The system has to be explicit about when a queued event is exact, when it is
best-effort, and when it must be quarantined instead of replayed.

This section defines the target contract for the concurrency-hardening work in
this example. The current code already has per-worktree queues and serialized
same-path capture, but future implementation still needs to enforce the explicit
branch-generation and same-branch multi-worktree guards described below.

Best-effort applies only to incomplete source payloads. Unsupported branch or
worktree topology is **not** best-effort; it is a quarantine case.

Canonical handling rule:

- If unsupported topology is detected **before enqueue**, the hook should reject
  the capture and record the failure visibly.
- If unsupported topology or a stale generation is discovered **after enqueue**,
  the worker should quarantine the row by settling it as `blocked_conflict` with
  an explicit reason.

### Exact versus best-effort sources

| Source | Capture fidelity | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| OpenCode `file.changed` payloads with explicit `changes[]` | Exact for the structured entries the payload reports | This is the preferred OpenCode surface. With the `opencode-hooks` plugin, `file.changed` fires for supported mutation tools such as `write`, `edit`, `multiedit`, `patch`, and `apply_patch`. The payload names the changed paths directly, so the hook can snapshot those paths without guessing. If the payload also adds extra `files[]` entries, those extras are additive best-effort hints rather than part of the exact structured operation set. |
| OpenCode `file.changed` payloads with `files[]` only and no structured `changes[]` | Best-effort | The event identifies candidate paths, but it does not preserve the exact operation set. |
| Claude/OpenCode edit-style tool payloads (for example `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`) | Exact for the explicit target paths in the payload | Exactness is only for the paths the tool reports, and only if the hook is wired to receive those tool events. Claude Code documents `Write` and `Edit`; do not assume undocumented tool names. |
| Generic payloads that expose only one path field (`file_path`, `path`, `files`, etc.) | Best-effort | The hook snapshots current contents of the discovered paths, but it cannot prove those paths are the complete edit set. |
| Harnesses that do not report per-edit changed files reliably, such as shell-driven edit flows | Best-effort | The queue may coalesce or miss intermediate file states because the hook is inferring paths after the fact. |

If a source is best-effort, the system should say that plainly. It should not
claim exact per-edit replay semantics for that event.

### Supported worktree and branch matrix

| Topology | Status | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| One worktree editing one checked-out branch | Supported for exact capture when the source is exact | The queue, worker, index, and branch checkout all belong to the same worktree. |
| Multiple worktrees in the same repo on different branches | Supported, with one independent queue per worktree | Branch refs differ, so the worktrees do not need cross-worktree branch coordination. |
| Multiple worktrees in the same repo on the **same** branch | Unsupported for autocommit replay | Branch refs are shared across worktrees but queue state is not. The hook should reject before enqueue when it can detect this early; otherwise the worker must quarantine instead of guessing. |
| Unborn branch / empty repo with no `HEAD` commit yet | Unsupported | The hook cannot record a stable `base_head` generation anchor before the first commit exists. |
| Detached HEAD | Unsupported | The hook skips capture because there is no symbolic branch ref to own the event stream. |

### Branch generation and quarantine semantics

- `events.base_head` is the capture-time ancestry anchor.
- The current implementation also uses a shared branch-incarnation signal in
  repo-common-dir state so branch delete-and-recreate can be distinguished from
  an ordinary fast-forward on the same branch name.
- A queued event is safe to replay only while the live branch still belongs to
  the same branch generation as that ancestry anchor plus incarnation signal.
- Fast-forward commits after capture are allowed. They stay in the same
  generation.
- If the branch is reset, rebased, force-moved, deleted, or recreated so the
  live tip is no longer a descendant of `base_head`, the queued event is stale.
- Deleting and recreating a branch starts a new generation even if the recreated
  ref later points to the same commit or a descendant. A new ref incarnation
  must not inherit the old pending queue implicitly.
- Stale or unsupported events must be quarantined by settling them as
  `blocked_conflict` with an explicit generation or topology reason. They must
  not be silently retried against the new branch incarnation.

This is the contract the current implementation is working toward enforcing:
exact
capture only in supported modes, explicit best-effort labeling for inferred
paths, and quarantine instead of opportunistic replay when branch identity is
no longer trustworthy.

### Mixed-fidelity events

One payload can mix exact structured operations and best-effort hints. For
example, an OpenCode `file.changed` event may provide exact `changes[]` entries
plus extra `files[]` entries that are only hints.

Downstream schema work therefore needs fidelity metadata that can represent
mixed events. The required contract is per-op fidelity (or an equivalent encoding
that preserves which captured paths were exact vs best-effort). Event-level-only
fidelity is not sufficient.

## Current guarantees and guardrails

- **Same-path hooks are serialized**
  - `path_tail` reads and writes happen inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
    transaction.
  - Two hooks racing on the same file do not capture the same `before` state.

- **Only one worker drains a worktree**
  - The worker takes a flock on `worker.lock`.
  - If another worker starts, it exits.
  - The hook prefers signalling a live worker over spawning a new one.

- **Worktrees stay isolated, but branch ownership does not**
  - Different git dirs mean different DBs, locks, logs, and workers.
  - That isolation is safe for different branches.
  - It is **not** enough to make same-branch multi-worktree replay exact.
    Exact mode therefore assumes one worktree owns a branch at a time.

- **Branch-specific replay**
  - Today, the worker only processes pending events for the currently checked
    out branch.
  - Events for other branches stay pending until that branch is active again.
  - That branch-name check is necessary but not sufficient. The current
    implementation also enforces shared branch generation checks and rejects or
    quarantines unsupported same-branch multi-worktree cases.

- **Crash recovery is explicit**
  - Today, leftover `publishing` rows are reconciled on startup.
  - If the target commit is already an ancestor of the branch tip, the event is
    marked `published`.
  - If the branch generation or ancestry no longer matches, the row is
    quarantined instead of being replayed into a new branch incarnation.

## Wiring

### Claude Code

Add this to `~/.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.json` in the repo:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 /abs/path/to/snapshot-hook.py",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Claude Code currently documents `Write` and `Edit` for file-edit hooks. If you
expand the matcher, do it only for tool names your harness actually emits.

#### GUI-launched harnesses and shell environment variables

This matters if you use the built-in AI commit messages (`SNAPSHOTD_AI_ENABLE`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) or any other env-var driven feature of this hook.

When Claude Code runs from a terminal (the `claude` CLI), the hook command
inherits your interactive shell environment, so exports in `~/.zshrc` or
`~/.bashrc` reach the hook and the worker.

When Claude Code runs from a GUI launcher, such as the Claude macOS desktop
app, Spotlight, the Dock, or an IDE extension that was started outside a
terminal, the harness inherits `launchd`'s environment instead of your shell's.
Your `~/.zshrc` exports are not visible to the hook, so the worker boots with
`AI_ENABLE=False` and an empty `OPENAI_API_KEY` and falls back to deterministic
commit messages. The same applies to any third-party GUI wrapper around a CLI
harness. OpenCode users typically run from a terminal, so this caveat is
Claude-desktop-specific in practice.

Two ways to fix it:

1. Wrap the hook command in a login+interactive shell so it re-sources your
   profile before exec:

   ```json
   "command": "/bin/zsh -ilc \"exec python3 /abs/path/to/snapshot-hook.py\""
   ```

   `-i` reads `~/.zshrc`, `-l` reads `~/.zprofile`/`~/.zlogin`. Use the flags
   that match where you actually export the vars. You can also inline env
   overrides ahead of `exec`:

   ```json
   "command": "/bin/zsh -ilc \"SNAPSHOTD_AI_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH=50 exec python3 /abs/path/to/snapshot-hook.py\""
   ```

2. Export the vars into `launchd` so every GUI app on the system sees them:

   ```bash
   launchctl setenv OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
   launchctl setenv SNAPSHOTD_AI_ENABLE 1
   ```

   This leaks the values to all GUI apps, survives reboots only if you persist
   it through a LaunchAgent, and is harder to rotate. Prefer option 1 unless
   you need a single global setup.

To verify the wrapper is passing env through, run the same command your hook
uses and inspect what the spawned shell actually sees:

```bash
/bin/zsh -ilc 'echo AI_ENABLE="${SNAPSHOTD_AI_ENABLE:-unset}" KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY:+set}"'
```

If `AI_ENABLE=unset` or `KEY` is empty, the exports are missing from the
profile files the shell actually reads, not from the hook wiring.

### OpenCode

Add this to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "id": "snapshot-autocommit",
      "event": "file.changed",
      "async": true,
      "actions": [
        { "bash": "python3 $HOOK_DIR/snapshot-hook.py" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With the `opencode-hooks` plugin, this `file.changed` hook is the intended
trigger surface for supported mutation tools such as `write`, `edit`,
`multiedit`, `patch`, and `apply_patch`.

### Codex

Codex CLI currently emits `Bash` PostToolUse events only. That means this hook
can do best-effort capture for shell-driven edits, but not exact per-edit
capture for every tool. If you need exact per-edit capture, use Codex
app-server or a shared MCP edit surface.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | What it controls |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `SNAPSHOTD_QUIET_SECONDS` | `1.0` | How long the worker waits after the last enqueue before replay starts |
| `SNAPSHOTD_IDLE_SECONDS` | `30.0` | How long the worker stays alive with no work on the current branch |
| `SNAPSHOTD_POLL_SECONDS` | `0.35` | Poll interval while waiting |
| `SNAPSHOTD_HEARTBEAT_STALE` | `15.0` | Age after which a worker heartbeat is treated as dead |
| `SNAPSHOTD_AI_ENABLE` | off | Enables built-in AI commit messages |
| `SNAPSHOTD_AI_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH` | `2` | Backlog depth above which built-in AI batching is skipped |
| `SNAPSHOTD_AI_CHUNK_SIZE` | `20` | Max events per structured-output AI request, clamped to `1..100` |
| `SNAPSHOTD_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CMD` | unset | Custom argv-style message command, run per event |
| `SNAPSHOTD_SENSITIVE_GLOBS` | `.env,*.pem,*.key,…` | Paths whose diffs are redacted before any network call |
| `SNAPSHOTD_RETENTION_SECONDS` | `604800` | How long settled rows are kept before pruning |
| `SNAPSHOTD_LOG_MAX_BYTES` / `_KEEP` | `2 MiB` / `3` | Log rotation threshold and retained files |
| `SNAPSHOTD_DEBUG` | off | Writes debug logs under `<git-dir>/ai-snapshotd/logs/` |
| `SNAPSHOTD_WORKER_PATH` | sibling file | Override worker script path |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | unset / OpenAI default | Required for built-in AI mode. Base URL must be `https://` |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Model used for built-in AI mode |
| `OPENAI_API_TIMEOUT` | `15` | Network timeout in seconds |

If neither `SNAPSHOTD_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CMD` nor `SNAPSHOTD_AI_ENABLE=1` is set,
the worker writes deterministic commit messages.

## Batch message generation

Built-in AI now works as a pre-pass, not a per-event network call.

When AI is enabled and the backlog is at or below
`SNAPSHOTD_AI_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH`, the worker does this before replaying commits:

1. Find events whose `events.message` is still `NULL`
2. Split them into chunks of `SNAPSHOTD_AI_CHUNK_SIZE`
3. Send one structured-output request per chunk
4. Persist returned messages into `events.message`
5. Build commits from stored messages, falling back to
   `SNAPSHOTD_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CMD` if configured, otherwise deterministic commit
   messages, for any event whose chunk failed

Why this design is better:

- It cuts prompt overhead on bursts because one request covers many events.
- It keeps replay predictable because generated messages are stored before the
  commit loop.
- It degrades cleanly. One bad chunk falls back to
  `SNAPSHOTD_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CMD` if configured, otherwise deterministic commit
  messages, for that chunk only.

Each request uses a JSON schema. The model has to return a `messages` array,
keyed by event `seq`. Sensitive-path redaction still happens per event before
anything leaves the machine.

### Tuning guidance

| Setting | Good starting point | Why |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| `SNAPSHOTD_AI_CHUNK_SIZE` | `20` | Large enough to amortize prompt overhead, small enough to keep responses manageable |
| `SNAPSHOTD_AI_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH` | `50` or `100` | With chunking, 100 queued events means 5 requests at chunk size 20, not 100 requests |
| `SNAPSHOTD_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CMD` | leave unset unless you need custom logic | Custom command generation still runs once per event, so it does not benefit from batching |

If you are still tuning the system, start with built-in batching. It is cheaper
and simpler than a custom per-event command.

## Operating commands

```bash
# Show queue status for a repo
python3 snapshot-worker.py --status --repo /path/to/repo

# Drain pending events synchronously
# Exit 0 if the current-branch queue is empty, 2 if events remain
python3 snapshot-worker.py --flush --repo /path/to/repo

# Run the worker in the foreground
python3 snapshot-worker.py --repo /path/to/repo
```

## Debugging

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir)

tail -n 200 "$GIT_DIR/ai-snapshotd/logs/hook.log"
tail -n 200 "$GIT_DIR/ai-snapshotd/logs/worker.log"

python3 snapshot-worker.py --status --repo .

sqlite3 "$GIT_DIR/ai-snapshotd/snapshotd.db" \
  "SELECT seq, state, branch_ref, tool_name, substr(commit_oid,1,8), error FROM events ORDER BY seq DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

## Security notes

- `SNAPSHOTD_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CMD` is parsed with `shlex.split` and executed as a
  plain argv list. No shell involved.
- Built-in OpenAI mode is off by default. To enable it, set both
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `SNAPSHOTD_AI_ENABLE=1`.
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` must use `https://`.
- Diffs for paths matching `SNAPSHOTD_SENSITIVE_GLOBS` are replaced with a
  redaction marker before any network request.
- If backlog depth exceeds `SNAPSHOTD_AI_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH`, built-in AI is
  skipped for that drain cycle.

The opinionated recommendation here is simple: keep sensitive globs broad, keep
the base URL HTTPS-only, and do not try to be clever about redaction.

## Known limitations

- Unix only. The worker uses advisory `fcntl` locks.
- Some harnesses do not report exact changed files for every tool. In those
  cases, capture is best-effort.
- Exact autocommit does not support multiple worktrees sharing the same branch
  unless later work adds explicit repo-global branch coordination.
- Branch rewrites are not safe to auto-replay across generations. Stale pending
  work must be quarantined instead.
- `blocked_conflict` events are recorded, not auto-retried.
- After a successful publish, the worker resets only the paths it just
  committed, and only when the live index still matches the pre-publish HEAD.
  If you staged different content for the same paths, it leaves that alone.
